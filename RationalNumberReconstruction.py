RATIONAL NUMBER RECONSTRUCTION

ZP2Q(c,m) applys Wang's rational number reconstruction for an integer c in a finite field mod m 

CRT_rat_recon implements the rational integer reconstruction algorithm combined with
the chinese remainder theorem as presented in the paper

Algorithm for producing efficency and maximum possible reconstruction plots is also included in
Plot_Time and Plot_MaxInt
